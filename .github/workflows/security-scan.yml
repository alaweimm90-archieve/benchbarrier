            ## Security Scan Alert
            
            A security vulnerability scan has detected issues in the codebase.
            
            **Scan Date**: ${new Date().toISOString()}
            **Workflow Run**: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
            
            Please review the scan results and take appropriate action.
            
            ### Next Steps
            1. Review the detailed scan results
            2. Assess the severity and impact
            3. Plan remediation
            4. Update dependencies or code as needed
            5. Re-run security scan to verify fixes
